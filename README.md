Scaffold and example application for zzaplib

With zzapapp, you have a prototype for a simple web application, 
based on the zzaplib framework. Zzap stands for speed and lighness.
With zzaplib you can build slim and fast web applications in very
little time.

The goals are reached mainly with leaving out every unneccessary 
feature. This minimalism is the reason not to use templateengines
like Smarty or Twig or ORMs like Doctrine or Propel.

However - if you really want to use such Elements in your 
application, it's esy to install them with composer.
